I want to eliminate the duplicate of this library in
GHC. The underlying TextDetails store types are different
though which is a problem:

 -> Use type classes (see new-pretty branch).
    [Duncan not a fan.]
	 [Make sure performance not lost.]

 -> Use a better underlying storage type.
    [Say add bytestring and text to TextDetails.]

 -> Use a fixed underlying storage type like
    Builder from Text or Bytestring but allow
	 input functions to take any type that can be
	 converted into one.
	 [ptext :: (a -> Builder) -> a -> Doc

Also would be useful to provide render functions to produce
Bytestring / Text builders.
