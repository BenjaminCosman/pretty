This repository contains John Hughes's pretty-printing library.
A Haskell library for pretty printing, useful in compilers and
other such tools. It has been heavily modified by Simon Peyton
Jones from John Hughe's original design.

The library uses the Cabal build system, so building is simply
a matter of running 'cabal install' or 'cabal configure &&
cabal build'.
